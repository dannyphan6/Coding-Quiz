# Coding-Quiz

## Introduction:
How well do you know JavaScript? Well, what better place to test your knowledge than here? Put your brain to the test and see how you do! This quiz was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. JavaScript is mainly used to populate the questions and record the user responses to check whether they're correct or not. There will be time deducted with each wrong answer. At the end of the quiz, you can record your name and have it stored.
